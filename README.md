How to install latest greenbone community edition on debian box.

There are a lot of good guys who explain this stuff. 
For example https://sadsloth.net/post/install-gvm-20_08-src-on-debian/

But there are tons problems in comments and suggestions how to fix them.

I spent several days trying to install and force to work Greenbone and now try to put it together.
